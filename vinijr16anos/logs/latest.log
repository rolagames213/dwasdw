[19:28:02] [main/INFO]: If this message is the only thing at the bottom of your log before a crash, you probably have a driver issue.

Possible solutions:
A) Make sure Minecraft is set to prefer high performance graphics in the OS and/or driver control panel
B) Check for driver updates on the graphics brand's website
C) Try reinstalling your graphics drivers
D) If still not working after trying all of the above, ask for further help on the Forge forums or Discord

You can safely ignore this message if the game starts up successfully.
